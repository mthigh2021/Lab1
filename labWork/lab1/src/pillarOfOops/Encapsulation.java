/*    4 pillars of oops 
 * - abstration 
 * the process of hiding implementation and process of an entity to reduce complexity or increase understanding of a system's properties 
 * 
 * - polymorphism 
 * the ability for objects, classes, variables, and /or methods to alter functionality while  maintaining structure.
 * 
 * - inheritance 
 *  the abiliyt for entities to adopt  variables(fields) and/or methods (behavior) from a parent class 
 *  this allows for instantiating child objects from said parent class
 *  is A relationship
 * 
 * -Encapsulation
 *  the Act of wrapping code into a single unit and then selectively exposing and restricting access to 
 *  that code based on functionality or use within classes 
 *  
 *  - classes should allow minimum necessary access to their members 
 *  - acess to class variables should be done through methods that can perform validation or are designed specifically to perform mutation or acessing functionality
 *  - these methods are commonly referred to as "getters' and setters 
 *  - Least amount of acess is standard practice 
 *  - we want classses to be the only ones responsible for themselves.
 *  
 *  ## acess Modifiers : How we achieve encapsulation in java 
 *  -public ==>> acessible to all classes everywhere
 *  -protected==>  all subclasses /children 
 *  - default==> acessible to all classes in the same package
 *  - private===> acesssable only with in the current class
 *  
 *
