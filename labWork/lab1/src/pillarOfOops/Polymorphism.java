/*polymorphism 
 * The ability for objects , clsses , variables and methods to alter functionality while maintaining structure 
 * the ability for java to take advantage of the diffrence between a * refrence varaible* and an *object in memory* (when the two are related by inheritance)
 * 
 * poly -> many morph -> form 
 * AN object type determine the behaviours it has 
 * - the refrence variable type determines which behavior type can be accessed
 * 
 * ** Method overloading and Method Overiding **
 * Method Overiding : changing the implementaion of an inherited behaviour 
 * - @Override 
 * - Method Overloading : multiple implemtations of a single behaviours, by changing the number or type of parameters 
 * 
 * 
 * Covairnce (covaraint typing)**
 * -Refrencing an instance of a superclass using its subclass (or vice versa)
 * ```java
 * 		car c = new Subaru();
 * 		
 * 		````
 * clss relationship 
 * > oop seeks to , whenever possible eliminate redundant or repetitive code. it want to promote code resue
 * - a class can :
 *   -> "inherit" states and behaviours from another 
 *    - is A relationship(has - an ) 
 *  -   
 * 
 * ##abstraction 
 * -- The process of hiding implementation and process of an entity to reduce complexity 
 * or increase understanding of a system's propertise .
 * -- we don't need to know *how* something works, only how to use it
 * - - iN java , we acheive this via Abstract classes and Interfaces
 * --*Abstracr classse* are structure that contain state and behaviours.
 *   -- If a behaviour is reliant aon what something *is* -> abstract class.
 *   - Use an abstract class whn we want to have a common "root" class, but don't want instantiate it.
 *   -- Adding more hiarchiacal structure to our code 
 *   
 * **INterfaces** better define behaviour only.
 * if the behaviour can be described separeately from the state ---> interface
 * -- use an interface when we want to define behaviour only.  
 *   -- Add functionality without affecting our parent class.
